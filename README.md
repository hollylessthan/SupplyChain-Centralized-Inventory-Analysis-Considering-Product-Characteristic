# SupplyChain-Centralized-Inventory-Analysis-Considering-Product-Characteristic

This is a course project from the Supply Chain Analytics course at UCSD, and the data set is obtained from the course as well. The goal of this project is to analyze which product inventory is appropriate to be centrized.

#### Language
Python 3.8.5 (default, Jul 28 2020, 12:59:40)

#### Context
In this project, I analyze three products and each product has 4 regional distribution centers. For each product, I first calculated the total costs for all four regional centers and considered the total cost for a national distribution center. I also examine the correlation between 4 regional centers for each product and their coefficient of variation.


#### Result

The cost analysis showed that only inventory of product 2 is appropriate to be centralized. Also, the centrization of a product can be affected by the correlation between regional centers and their coefficient of variation. Other factors that I did not explore in this case but is common in deciding inventory centralization may be a product is a slow moving product or fast moving product.
